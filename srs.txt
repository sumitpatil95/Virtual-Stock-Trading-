### 1. **Introduction**

#### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this SRS document is to outline the requirements and specifications for developing a Virtual Stock Trading Platform. The platform will simulate a real-world trading environment, providing users with features like market data, portfolio tracking, and trading functionalities without real financial risks. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, designers, and stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the system’s objectives and functionality.

#### 1.2 Scope

This project will allow users to:
1. Register, log in, and manage their profiles.
2. Access real-time market data and stock information.
3. Buy and sell stocks, similar to an actual stock trading experience.
4. Track their portfolio, holdings, and transaction history.
5. View analytical charts and indicators for stocks.

The frontend of this project will be built using React, while the backend will utilize Django and Django REST Framework.

#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **REST API**: Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface.
- **CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format.

### 3. **Functional Requirements**

#### 3.1 User Management

1. **Registration**: Users can create an account by providing a username, password, and email.
2. **Authentication**: Users can log in with their credentials.
3. **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit profile details.

#### 3.2 Market Data Integration

1. **Real-Time Stock Prices**: Display real-time prices for selected stocks using a financial API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).
2. **Company Information**: Provide essential company data such as market cap, P/E ratio, and daily high/low prices.
3. **Historical Data**: Fetch historical prices for stocks to enable charting and analytics.

#### 3.3 Portfolio Management

1. **Holdings**: Display a user’s holdings, including stock symbols, quantity, average purchase price, and current market value.
2. **Transaction History**: Log all user transactions (buy/sell) with details like date, stock symbol, quantity, and transaction type.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Display portfolio performance metrics, such as total value, profit/loss, and return on investment (ROI).

#### 3.4 Trading Functionality

1. **Place Orders**:
   - **Market Order**: Execute a trade at the current market price.
   - **Limit Order**: Execute a trade when the stock price meets a specified target.
2. **Order Confirmation**: Provide confirmation before executing a trade.
3. **Transaction Limits**: Set limits on transactions based on virtual account balance and stock availability.

#### 3.5 Analytics & Charts

1. **Stock Charts**: Display stock trend charts using a charting library (e.g., Chart.js or D3.js).
2. **Technical Indicators**: Integrate basic indicators like Moving Averages, Volume, and Price Change Percentage.
3. **Comparison**: Allow users to compare stock trends over different timeframes (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 1 year).

### 4. **Non-Functional Requirements**

#### 4.1 Security

- Use secure methods for password storage and user authentication (e.g., bcrypt hashing, JWT tokens).
- Protect all endpoints against unauthorized access using token-based authentication.

#### 4.2 Performance

- Real-time stock data updates should have a latency of no more than 5 seconds.
- Page load times should be kept under 3 seconds to ensure smooth user experience.

#### 4.3 Usability

- The platform should be intuitive, providing easy-to-use interfaces for trading, portfolio management, and analytics.
- Support responsive design for use on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### 4.4 Scalability

- The system should be designed to support up to 1,000 concurrent users and can be scaled further based on load requirements.

#### 4.5 Availability

- The platform should be available 24/7, with maintenance times communicated in advance to users.

### 5. **System Architecture**

#### 5.1 System Components

1. **Frontend** (React):
   - Components for User Registration, Login, and Profile Management.
   - Portfolio and Trading Dashboard.
   - Stock Chart Component for displaying stock trends.
   - Analytics Component for displaying technical indicators.

2. **Backend** (Django and Django REST Framework):
   - User Authentication System (JWT-based authentication).
   - API Endpoints for handling trades, fetching stock data, and managing portfolios.
   - Integration with financial data APIs for real-time stock prices.

3. **Database**:
   - Use PostgreSQL or MySQL to store user data, portfolio holdings, and transaction history.

#### 5.2 Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users send authentication requests (login/register) from the frontend to Django REST APIs.
2. **Market Data**:
   - The frontend requests stock data from the Django backend, which fetches data from a third-party financial API and returns it to the frontend.
3. **Trading**:
   - Trading actions trigger updates to the user’s portfolio and transaction history in the database.

   - **Portfolio Table**: Show a table of holdings, including stock name, quantity, and market value.

2. **Trading Screen**:
   - **Stock Search**: Enable users to search for stocks and display live prices.
   - **Order Form**: Provide options for market and limit orders, with fields for stock quantity and price.

3. **Analytics Page**:
   - **Charts**: Display a line chart of stock prices over different timeframes.
   - **Technical Indicators**: Allow users to overlay indicators like moving averages on charts.

4. **Profile Page**:
   - **User Information**: Show profile details with options to edit email and password.
